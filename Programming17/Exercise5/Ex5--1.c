/*
1. A twin prime is a prime number that differs
from another prime number by two.
Some examples of twin prime pairs are
(3, 5), (5, 7), (11, 13), (17, 19), (29, 31) and (41, 43).
Write a program that stores 20 twin primes larger than 'a'
in an array and displays them on the screen.
'a' is any positive integer, entered with the the keyboard,
smaller than 1000. The program should be immune to improper
syntax (for example other characters entered)
or to numbers with the values out of range.
